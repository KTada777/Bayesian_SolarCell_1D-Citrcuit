18 Sep 2025:
1. It is reported that codes in the notebooks no longer work due to the recent syntax change of PyMC.<br>
 Amended versions starting with "250918" have been uploaded.<br>
2. Some old notebooks cannot be opened because of compatibility issues between GitHub and Colab notebooks.<br>
 https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/155944<br>
 Notebooks containing "R1," which work around this issue, have been uploaded for viewing purposes only.<br>
